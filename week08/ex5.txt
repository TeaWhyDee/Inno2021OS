RAM stores data. Physical addresses point directly to that
data. Amount of space and physical addresses available is 
bounded by hardware.
Virtual address is an abstraction used in Operating Systems
to handle sharing space between processes.
Virtual address points to a physical address.
The Operating System keeps track and manages virtual 
addresses and where they point to.
