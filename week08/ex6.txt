Virtual address is 16 bit.
Maximum offset portion of a virtual address should be equal to the page size.
Therefore, the offset is 13 bits.
Therefore, the page number portion of the virtual address is 16-13=3 bits.
Therefore, there are 2^3 = 8 page entries in the page table.

The anwer can also be calculated in the following way:
<virtual address size> / <page size>
2^16 / 2^13 = 8
