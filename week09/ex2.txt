If I have the same pagaes repeating often, the hit
amount is very high. For example, if we only ever
request the same page, miss amount will be 1
(for the first time we requested that page).

If there are rarely repeating pages, miss ratio is higher.
For example, if we never have the same page in 17 consecutive
page reference requests, amount of misses will be equal
to amount of page reference requests.
